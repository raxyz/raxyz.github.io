I got the lifeboat down alone
The water chilled me to my bones
I slowly rowed myself to shore
'Cause you didn't want me anymore

I watched the ship into the sea
With all hands lost but me
It was a ship that shared your name
Mm-hmmm

I woke up shakin' in the sand
The flag was still clutched in my hand
I could see nothing through the smoke
And I cried to God, "Is this some sick joke?"

'Cause I was a kid upon the sea
But all you got was me
It was a ship that shared your name
Mm-hmmm

And all of these things I have done
What is this madness that I have become?
Hold on, please be brave, it's my soul I must say
And I know I will swim home starting tomorrow

I fought the tides and battled waves
The waters beat me down for days
I found the figurehead and knew
The gods were guiding me to you

I held the splinters of a ghost
And swam out for the coast
It was a ship that shared your name
Mm-hmmm

And all of these things I have done
What is this madness that I have become?
Hold on, please be brave, it's my soul I must say
And I know I will swim home starting tomorrow

I sent my love into the deep
With promises I couldn't keep
But if my heart is true (is true), I will find some way to you (to you)
To make my way back home
Oh, oh

And all of these things we have done
Is part of this madness that we have become
Hold on, please be brave, it's the soul we must save
And now I will swim home starting tomorrow
