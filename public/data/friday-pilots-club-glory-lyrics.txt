Sovereignty up on a hill
Shooting guns and passing bills
Promising the world could be alright

If these people, these sheep
Could just quit and believe
In the system of pretending that everything is fine

Whispered words start revolutions
Weary souls break constitutions
And glory only comes when the good
When the good die young

Take another, a sister or brother
You're egging me on, if you
Take the only ones who'd care when I'm gone

I'm too angry to sleep
Too tired to keep runnin'
But I'm wanted by a God
Who's so afraid of death
He's starting to become it

Oh, power, power
A hero calls
From the bottom of a bottle (bottle)
Watch him fall

Let whispered words start revolutions
Weary souls break constitutions
And glory only comes when the good
When the good die young

Give me power, power
A hero calls
From bottom of a bottle (bottle)
Watch him fall

Whispered words start revolutions
Weary souls break constitutions
And glory only comes when the good
When the good die young (glory!)
When they die young
When the good die young
When the good die young
