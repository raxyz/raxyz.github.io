Well everyone's the hero in their own story
Everyone's a sucker for a taste of glory
But stories are for children
And glory's not a taste I can acquire

And people say that wishes are the path to freedom
See the stars a-shining, honey
You could be one
But pipe dreams flush away and in
The cold grey light of day they expire

'Cause I've built my castle on broken dreams
And as time goes by, I must admit it seems like
I was sold a lie
Makes me want to cry so loud
So loud

'Cause it's tough to be a dreamer when they don't come true
Nothing seems to happen and you can't break through
Feel like your blossoming is overdue
And you realize no one's gonna give the world to you

Well ain't no use in crying, darling
So they say
Find a thing you love to do and make it pay
Nothing you accomplish matters anyway
So all that really counts is how you live today

Well I'm not one to get uptight for no good reason
While some might see decay I see a change of season
And everyone's got problems
No more or less pathetic than mine

'Cause I'm trying to project a sunny disposition
But it's hard to paint a smile on wasted young ambition
And every day's another little grain of sand lost to the mists of time

'Cause if I can't make it, then what's the point?
If my whole damn life is set to disappoint
Well I guess there's nothing left to do but smile, so smile

'Cause it's tough to be a dreamer when they don't come true
Nothing seems to happen and you can't break through
Feel like your blossoming is overdue
And you realize no one's gonna give the world to you

Well ain't no use in crying, darling
So they say
Find a thing you love to do and make it pay
Nothing you accomplish matters anyway
So all that really counts is how you live today

Well if this is that ever will be, that's okay
But there's no damn noise left to drown out
The sound of the petals that sigh as they're falling away

'Cause it's tough to be a dreamer when they don't come true
Nothing seems to happen and you can't break through
Feel like your blossoming is overdue
And you realize no one's gonna give the world to you

Well ain't no use in crying, darling
So they say
Find a thing you love to do and make it pay
Nothing you accomplish matters anyway
So all that really counts, all that really counts
Ooooh, Oooooh, Ooooh, Yeah!
