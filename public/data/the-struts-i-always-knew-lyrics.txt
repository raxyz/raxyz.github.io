15 Down, down in my bones
20 Somewhere I'd never have known
90 Right at the back of my head
It hit me like a beam of light
Hit me like a hook of the right
And I could have fell to the floor

'Cause you talk to me and
it comes off the wall
You talk to me and it goes over my head
So let's go to bed
before you say something real
Let's go to bed
before you say how you feel

'Cause it's you
Oh, it's always you
Oh, I always knew
Oh baby, it's you


I try my best to unwind
Nothing on my mind,
nothing at all but you
Oblivious to all that I owe
I'm hanging on to what I don't know

So let's go to bed
before you say something real
Let's go to bed
before you say how you feel

'Cause it's you
Oh, I always knew
Oh, it's always you
Oh baby, it's you Yeah

And I knew
Yes I always knew
Yes I always knew
Oh baby it's you


You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing


Ever since I left the city,
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down,
you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city,
you you you started wearing
less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne
out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls
I've never seen before


You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
yeah
