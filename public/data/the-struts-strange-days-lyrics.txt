When you stumble and fall, get yourself off the ground
Play your favorite song and sing it out loud
Take a deep breath and in time you'll begin to smile

Listen to the wind, it's the sweetest of sounds
Smilin' at the stranger on the underground
Every little thing that you do goes a long, long way

But we don't' talk about it
But isn't it good to be down here alive?
Something money could never buy
It's worth more than a million roses

Oh these are strange days
In many strange ways
Science fiction I believе
Has become reality
Oh thеse are strange times
Lost in our mi-minds
We don't know, it's unclear
Where we'll be this time next year
Oh-oh-oh-oh, strange days
Strange days

Girls and boys are rushing to be on show
What's the hurry children? You're forgetting to grow
Make the best of where you begin in this crazy world

So let's talk about it
I know you sometimes hate the way that you feel
Life's about this, what makes you real, uh-uh-uh
It's worth more than a million roses

Oh these are strange days
In many strange ways
A message to out of space
Send help 'cause we lost our way
Oh these are strange times
Lost in our minds
We're standing by, we can't grow
Inside of this TV show
Oh-oh-oh-oh, strange days
Strange days

Oh these are strange days
In many strange ways
Science fiction I believe
Has become reality
Oh these are strange times
Lost in our mi-minds
We don't know, it's unclear
Where we'll be this time next year
Oh-oh-oh-oh, strange days
Strange days

Strange days
