You come and go in and out of my life
That two dollar talk and that million dollar smile
I hear you knocking, I said: "Oh, not again"
I tell you to go, but the next thing I know I'll be letting you back in

'Cause when you're rocking me, rolling me, loving me, holding me, oh, what can I do?
I get a rush coming over me, baby, I'm totally at the mercy of you
I can say that I'm quitting you, then I start missing you
Jonesing wanting you back 'cause you're the best bad habit I ever had

The taste of your kiss is like a little too much wine
When you turn it on mama, you burn me every time
Craving your touch, yeah, I need a fix
Of all of the things that are bad for me, you're the one that I don't wanna kick

'Cause when you're rocking me, rolling me, loving me, holding me, oh, what can I do?
I get a rush coming over me, baby, I'm totally at the mercy of you
I can say that I'm quitting you, then I start missing you
Jonesing wanting you back 'cause you're the best bad habit I ever had

'Cause when you're rocking me, rolling me, loving me, holding me, oh, what can I do?
I get a rush coming over me, baby, I'm totally at the mercy of you
I can say that I'm quitting you, then I start missing you
Jonesing wanting you back 'cause you're the best bad habit
You're the best bad habit, you're the best bad habit I ever had
