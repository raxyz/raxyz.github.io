Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Running in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain

Oh! Keep it together!
Oh! Keep it together!
Oh! Keep it together! (I run in the shadow)
Oh! Keep it together! (I'm running in the shadows)
Oh! Keep it together! (Still running in the shadows)
Oh! Keep it together! (I'll run in the shadow)

I'm running in the shadows
I'm still running in the shadows
