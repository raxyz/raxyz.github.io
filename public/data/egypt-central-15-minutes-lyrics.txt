There you sit, distorting your reflection
But the lights around the mirror have all gone dim
'Cause you did whatever it took to make a connection
Yeah you did whatever it took to make it in

For fifteen minutes of fame
What would you do?
Who would you hurt
And who would you screw?
Would you kill for the sake of making a name?
For fifteen minutes of shame

You wear a mask but don't know who's behind it
You fear the face of who you really are
'Cause you did whatever it took to get invited
And you do whatever it takes to be a star

For fifteen minutes of fame
What would you do?
Who would you hurt
And who would you screw?
Would you kill for the sake of making a name?
For fifteen minutes of shame

For fifteen minutes of fame
What would you do?
Who would you hurt
And who would you screw?
Would you kill for the sake of making a name?
For fifteen minutes of shame

I know you think
That you were someone special
But you're not
And you're the only one to blame

For fifteen minutes of fame
What would you do?
Who would you hurt
And who would you screw?
Would you kill for the sake of making a name?
For fifteen minutes of shame

For fifteen minutes of fame
What would you do?
Who would you hurt
And who would you screw?
Would you kill for the sake of making a name?
For fifteen minutes of shame
