So what if I'm wasted
Or dreaming? Baby, don't go changing
Let me feel the light
Let me feel

Tonight
She's wearing gold and bones and eager eyes
I already know, I already know that I can't fight
She makes me wanna do wrong
She makes being bad feel so damn right
But not in this light

'Cause she says she'll change, but I don't want that
Matter fact, I'll never look back
Your change ain't gonna cure what ails me, oh

Maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, love don't go changing
For once, I feel alive
Hell, let's face it, we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted?
God, I'm satisfied

And for the thousandth time
You can walk all over me
As we toe the line
Between feeling alive and feeling fine

But I won't beg, and I won't look back
'Cause somewhere deep I know you want that
I'm patient, but patience ain't what gonna make it alright

Oh, maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, love don't go changing
For once, I feel alive
Hell, let's face it, we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted?
God, I'm satisfied

Satisfied
Let me feel

Hey, hey, so, maybe I'm wasted
Or dreaming, love don't go changing
For once, I feel alive
Hell, let's face it, we're wasting our time
So what if I'm wasted?
God, I'm satisfied
