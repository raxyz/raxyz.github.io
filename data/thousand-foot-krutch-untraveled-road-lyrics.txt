Hold on for a second
If words can be weapons,
Then what I say can affect it.
They're not just words on a record.

And I can choose to respect it,
Or choose to infect it.
But once that hits the water,
It's too late to be selective.

'Cause one voice is enough,
To make sleeping giants wake up.
To make armies put their hands up.
And watch whole nations stand up.
It's one belief, one spark,
One faith and one restart.
And we can reboot the whole chart,
Before it all falls apart
So stand up, shout it out.
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud.
We only got one shot, so let's make it count.
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now.
Stand up, shout it out.
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out.
And before we depart let's leave a mark.
'Cause light shines brighter in the dark.

When we scream,
Our lips don't make a sound.
We march with feet on solid ground.
We walk, where no one wants to go,
On this untraveled road.

So hold on for a moment,
If we're not scared of opponents,
Then with what we have we can own it.
We just plant the seed and keep growin' it
And when that light shines in the mornin',
They'll still be wakin' up yawnin'.
We'll be smilin' like we expected.
Sweet victory, one method.

'Cause one voice is enough,
To make sleeping giants wake up.
To make armies put their hands up.
And watch whole nations stand up.
It's one belief, one spark,
One faith and one restart.
And we can reboot the whole chart,
Before it all falls apart
So stand up, shout it out.
We can put 'em in the air if you like it loud.
We only got one shot, so let's make it count.
It's a take down, nobody can stop us now.
Stand up, shout it out.
Sing it loud, so the world can't drown us out.
And before we depart let's leave a mark.
