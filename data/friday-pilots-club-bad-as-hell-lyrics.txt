All this shade but no tea
I'm growing thirsty here in all this heat
Honey, I'm lost but
These people got me caught up
What it seems like they need
They always want me but never wanna please
Where you going after? Whatcha need now?

Well this vice, this sweet temptation
The answer to frustration
Put it down on me, put it down
Put it down on me

Well my girl, she's bad as hell
You know a little fucked up now but oh well
My battle cry, my rebel yell
My God my girl she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Oh my God, my girl's bad as hell

So much to give and she knows it too
And there's so much to say about
A girl with nothing to prove
She's in my head now telling me just how
She's my vice, my sweet temptation
Make me question my salvation
Put it down on me, put it down
Put it down on me

Well my girl, she's bad as hell
You know a little fucked up now but oh well
My battle cry, my rebel yell
My God my girl she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Oh my God, my girl's bad as hell

This vice, this sweet temptation
The answer to frustration
Put it down on me, put it down
Put it down on me

My girl, she's bad as hell
You know we're all fucked up now but oh well
My battle cry, my rebel yell
My God my girl she's bad as hell
Oh lord, she's bad as hell
Oh my God, my girl's bad as hell
Bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell
Yeah, she's bad as hell yeah, she's bad
