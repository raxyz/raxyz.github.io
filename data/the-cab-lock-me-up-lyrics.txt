Time to listen to
My confession
I'm much less than
I wanted to be wanted to be, wanted to be
You shine a light on my
Dark side but you
Don't care what you see

Overjoyed
Over you
Overnight
That's what you do
Why don't you

Lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire
I don't want you to stop
Lock me in and hold this moment
Never get enough
Ain't no way I'm ever breaking free
Lock me up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lock me up

Criticize you don't analyse me 'cause
You can see what I'm trying, to be trying to be
I've been lost and I've been blinded by
All the things that I've seen

Overjoyed
Over you
Overnight
Girl, that's what you do
So why don't you

Lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire
I don't want you to stop
Lock me in and hold this moment
Never get enough
Ain't no way I'm ever breaking free
Lock me up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Lock me up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Lock me up

Overjoyed
Over you
Overnight
Girl, that's what you do
So why don't you

Lock me up with joy and kisses?
Lock me up with love?
Chain me to your heart's desire
I don't want you to stop
Lock me in and hold this moment
Never get enough
Ain't no way I'm ever breaking free
Lock me up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Lock me up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (why don't ya?)
Lock me up
