I don't like it, for a minute
I don't wanna be, in silence
I don't need no phones or TVs all night long

I just like it, when I hear it
Those rhythm and blues combining
The need to tap your feet, and snap your fingers along

Yeah, just like that, come on

When you find it, you're gonna feel it
It's gonna crawl down deep inside you
Feel your heartbeat beat like a drummer beats this song

Ooh, a little melody, as the horns start blowin' my way
Feel the bass now rolling nicely
And the band is coming strong

Turn it up!

I wanna hear it, I just wanna hear that music play
To get me through a new day
And everything's goin' my way

Turn it up!

I wanna hear it, I just wanna hear that music play
To get me through a new day
And everything's goin' my way

Hmm I'm gonna ride it, no rhyming, and keep on flowin'
I'm rollin', the beat's gonna keep on goin'
'Til it reaches downtown

Hmm I comin' to play that tune that's driving through
All the rata-ta-tats and too-too-toos
'Cause I like it, ooh I really like it when you say

Turn it up!

I wanna hear it, I just wanna hear that music play
To get me through a new day
And everything's goin' my way

Turn it up!

I wanna hear it, I just wanna hear that music play
To get me through a new day
And everything's goin' my way, ah yeah

Turn it up!

I wanna hear it, I just wanna hear that music play
To get me through a new day
And everything's goin' my way

Turn it up!

I wanna hear it, I just wanna hear that music play
To get me through a new day
And everything's goin' my way

Come on [home?], go play!
