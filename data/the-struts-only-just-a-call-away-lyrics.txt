All that you want
Is a love I can't provide
And no matter what I try feels like we're fallin'
Cause I'm leavin' home
One more toke and I'll be gone
And I'll be savin' all these ashes till the morning
When the sun comes from the west
That's where you'll find my silhouette
Or ride a cloud come back to you
Without a warning (warning)

Don't speak cause it only makes my
Heart bleed no matter what you say
I'll be only just a call away (away)
I need to know that I've got you
With me no matter what they say
I'll be only just a call away (away)

Close your eyes in the night
And I'll be right in front of you
So sit back enjoy the view until the morning
When the sun comes from the west
That's where you'll find my silhouette
Or ride a cloud come back to you
Without a warning (warning)

Don't speak cause it only makes my
Heart bleed no matter what you say
I'll be only just a call away (away)
I need to know that I've got you
With me no matter what they say
I'll be only just a call away (away)

We'll take it one day at a time
So just save every tear you cry
I've come too far to let you down
And baby don't you know that

Don't speak cause it only makes my
Heart bleed no matter what you say
I'll be only just a call away (away)
I need to know that I've got you
With me no matter what they say
I'll be only just a call away (away)
