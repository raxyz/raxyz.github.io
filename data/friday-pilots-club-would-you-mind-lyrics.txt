18 Ignition on this wonderful night of submission
26 Promises break when she's away from home
35 Can I listen for the drag of the hands towards fission?
43 She's losing battles to tempting shadows when she's alone
50 For all that I know

52 You needed someone else to help you forget the reason
58 You fell for me at all, in this hell of a season
64 If I spend the night in the gaze of strange eyes
69 Would you mind, dear? Oh, would you mind?

93 Been tasting this sweet little lie from Eden
101 She reached the bruised, Forbidden fruit with such ease
107 While she's wasting away she'll say there's no meanin'
119 To his touch, to his love, but she still needs to blame it on me

128 Did you need somebody else to help you forget the reason
134 That you fell for me at all in this hell of a season?
139 If I spend the night in the gaze of strange eyes
145 Would you mind, dear? Oh, would you mind?

154 Look I get it 
155 You ain't friends with the monsters in your head 
160 I too am a sinner
162 But my sins ain't in your bed
166 You said before you felt lonely
171 So how does it feel now that you don't own me?

180 'Cause if you needed someone else to help you fight off your demons
186 You're just a body, just a shell just a heart that stopped beating
192 So when I spent the night in the gaze of strange eyes 
197 Would you mind?
200 Oh, tell me would you mind?
208 Oh, would you mind?
213 Yes I know that you'll mind
