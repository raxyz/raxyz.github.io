Ignition on this wonderful
Night of submission
Promises break when she's away from home
Can I listen for the drag
Of the hands towards fission?
She's losing battles to tempting
Shadows when she's alone
For all that I know

You needed someone else to help
You forget the reason
You fell for me at all
In this hell of a season
If I spend the night in
The gaze of strange eyes
Would you mind, dear? Oh, would you mind?

Been tasting this sweet little lie from Eden
She reached the bruised
Forbidden fruit with such ease
While she's wasting away she'll
Say there's no meanin'
To his touch, to his love
But she still needs to blame it on me

Did you need somebody else to
Help you forget the reason
That you fell for me at all
In this hell of a season?
If I spend the night in
The gaze of strange eyes
Would you mind, dear? Oh, would you mind?

Look I get it you ain't friends with the
Monsters in your head i too am a sinner
But my sins ain't in your bed
You said before you felt lonely
So how does it feel now
That you don't own me?

'Cause if you needed someone else to
Help you fight off your demons
You're just a body, just a shell
Just a heart that stopped beating
So when I spent the night in
The gaze of strange eyes would you mind?
Oh, tell me would you mind?
Oh, would you mind?
Yes I know that you'll mind
